<h1 align="center">Dragonball Characters API</h1>
<h2 align="center">A fan-built API supplying information about your favorite Dragonball, Dragonball Z, Dragonball Super, and Dragonball GT characters.</h3>



### :construction: This API is actively under construction! ###

#### Some Notes:

- Only Yo-kai that were released as part of the 'normal' medal range are currently included

- I plan to add more Dragonball Characters and information about each character as I am able 

#### Tech Stuff:

- This API was created using node.js and Express

- API was deployed using Heroku

#### Improvements/Optimizations coming:

- Documentation! I want this API to be easily navigated by all fans

- Import data to MongoDB. As the data base grows, it only makes sense to store it in a cloud


### :star: Try it Out

- API is live at: [Heroku API page](https://dragonball-characters-api.herokuapp.com/)

### :fire: Thank you!
